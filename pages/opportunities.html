      <h3> Palantir: WOMEN IN TECHNOLOGY SCHOLARSHIP (NORTH AMERICA) </h3>
      <p>
      Palantir launched the Palantir Women in Technology Scholarship in 2010 to celebrate and support women who are beginning careers in technology such as computer science, engineering, and technical studies
      to encourage women to pursue these fields and to become leaders in these fields.
      
      </br> 
      </br> 
      This year, 10 scholarship recipients will be chosen and invited to visit our headquarters in Palo Alto for a full-day, all-expenses paid developmental workshop. 
      Programming will include professional development sessions, breakouts with our engineers, and some fun social activities!
      All recipients are awarded grants of <b> $7,000 (you can buy over 1000 bubble tea's with that!) to support their education (this sounds like a much better idea though :] ). </b>

      </br>
      </br> 
      <b> The 2019 application period is now open. The deadline to apply is Sunday, March 24, 2019 at 11:59 PM PST. MAKE SURE YOU APPLY ASAP! </b>
